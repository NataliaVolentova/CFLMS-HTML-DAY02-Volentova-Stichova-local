			<p>Do you recall, not long ago
			We would walk on the sidewalk
			Innocent, remember?
			All we did was care for each other
			But the night was warm
			We were bold and young
			</p>
			
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				All around the wind blows
		We would only hold on to let go
		Blow a kiss, fire a gun
		We need someone to lean on
		Blow a kiss, fire a gun
		All we need is somebody to lean on
		Blow a kiss, fire a gun
		We need someone to lean on
		Blow a kiss, fire a gun
		All we need is somebody to lean on
		What will we do when we get old?
		Will we walk down the same road?
		Will you be there by my side?
		Standing strong as the waves roll over
		When the nights are long
		Longing for you to come home
		All around the wind blows
		Do you recall, not long ago
		We would walk on the sidewalk
		Innocent, remember?
